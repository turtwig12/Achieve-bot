# How to use

download the python file, if you have a python interpreter this will make this easy to run, if you do not it will be harder.
### I don't understand python
This will only take a few minutes to get set up, first download the file like normal
after this is done open command prompt(⊞+R "cmd") after this is open type the command "python" this will either allow you to run python scripts after downloading an interpreter, or it will open the Microsoft store where you can download the interpreter, while in command prompt also run the comand "pip install selenium". After this is done open the file ending with .py/the file type is PY open with notepad (if prompted if you want to open this file type just once or always select just once). After the file is opened change the username and password variables to your username and password (i.e. password="your_password"). After this is done close the file saving the changes, making sure that the file is actualy closed and not just notepad. Double click the file and it should work, it may take a few seconds but a Google for testing tab should open up

### I understand python
if you understand python then open up your chosen python packages, preferably running locally (if you do not have one of these I would recommend pycharm) install the packages needed with "pip install selenium", replace password and username with your achieve password and username


# Program not working

### General
This program is made to stable and not need to be monitored after starting

### Possible  bugs
there are a few reasons why the program my crash/not work
1. python not installed corectly/run incorectly
2. username or password input incorectly
3. slow wi-fi/not working
4. program ran too fast
5. command prompt is not opening
6. computer turned off
7. python won't install
8. achieve has changed

### Summory and solutions
many of these problems are easy to fix
1. To check python is running correctly go into command prompt type "python" and enter, a short string will appear after this and say something about python, next line type print("test") if python is running correctly then this should result in the word "test" being displayed
2. This does not need explaining but to test if they are correct just log into achieve normally with those credentials
3. As this program interacts with the web it need access to the internet to work, if Wi-Fi is slow the program may crash but most likely it will just go slower than expected, to test just search on google to see if the internet is working, to make Wi-Fi faster turn off VPN's if active, also turning router off and on often helps
4.Even though this program is built with pauses it can still act faster than it can load, this one is easy to fix, just run it again, in testing it was rare and only occurred on the first question
5. This is often due to not having right permissions on the computer, try using the ⊞+R "C:\Windows\WinSxS\wow64_microsoft-windows-commandprompt_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.26100.3624_none_310f59b7fed2d46f\cmd.exe" this is often not blocked but the same
6. Go into power setting and change them so the computer does not turn off
7. This is similar to point five, Microsoft store is often blocked if you do not have correct permissions on a computer, there is no work around, use a different computer
8. please add a bug report

# How do I get this to work for other subjects?
You have two options for this, A find a python course online that can teach you how to change the program if you do this please create a branch of this program for it, B comment on this repository, get in contact with Turtwig12 or anyone else who can program in python or finally post it on r/Python

# how hashtag learning could fix this 
if you are from hashtag learning the easiest way to stop this program from working would be to randomise the order that the answers are in, an answer is always A. This will make this program not work but it could still be modified in a short period of time to work again, a more permanent fix would be to add a capture when login, not allow streaks to be counted if done only for a specific topic and only count if it is chosen from the whole course, this would make the program about 1000 lines longer but would still work, a final method would be to limit how many questions someone can answer per minute, as I have been able to get more than twice the speed of what is humanly possible.
